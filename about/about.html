    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The Surrealist Inner Society is a group of explorers, researchers, 
      developers, artists, and thinkers who seek to explore the unconscious 
      mind and the irrational aspects of reality. We believe that by accessing
      the surreal, we can unlock new ways of seeing and understanding the world around us. 
      Through a variety of mediums, including machine learning, neural networks, natural language 
      processing, deep learning, artificial intelligence, art, writing, and performance, we seek to
      challenge conventional ways of thinking and push the boundaries of human consciousness for the 
      advancement of social well-being.</p>
