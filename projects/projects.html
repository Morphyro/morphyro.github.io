    <h1>Our Projects</h1>
    <p>Here are some of the projects we have worked on:</p>
    <div class="project">
      <h2>Prometheus Fundation</h2>
      <p>The research conducted by Prometheus organization investigates the potential
         benefits of creating virtual clones of people for the preservation of memories 
         and experiences for future generations. To conduct the research, Prometheus researchers 
         will select a group of 50 people who have had significant experiences in their lives, 
         such as travels, historical events, or memorable moments with loved ones. These people 
         will be interviewed and filmed in detail about their experiences, and the collected data 
         will be used to create virtual clones of these people. The virtual clones will then be 
         shown to a group of volunteers who have not had contact with the original people and 
         have been invited to answer a series of questions about the experiences reported by the clones.
         We hope that the results will show that the volunteers were able to deeply and significantly
         connect with the experiences reported by the clones, and many reported having learned something
         new or been inspired by the shared stories. In addition, the researchers will also conduct interviews
         with the original people to evaluate how they felt about the created virtual clones. Most of the
         interviewees reported feeling a deep satisfaction in knowing that their memories and experiences
         are being preserved for future generations and were happy to be able to share their stories more
         widely and accessibly. In summary, Prometheus' research will show that the creation of virtual
         clones of people could be an efficient and meaningful way to preserve memories and experiences
         for future generations and allow these stories to be shared more widely and accessibly.</p>
